# Vehicle-Accident-Reporting-Device
V.A.R.D powered by MSP430 TI Launchpad microcontroller

The sole purpose of this project entitled Vehicle Accident Reporting Device (V.A.R.D) is to take advantage of the technology, improve the response time of authorized persons during crisis and help reduce tragic events from happening. Since prevention is not possible as accidents happen when they happen, it is better to improve the services that cater to those that is affected by certain accidents. This project is designed to notify authorities and family members immediately when it involves a four- wheeled vehicle accidents. 

Since there are some cases where reporting an accident using a mobile phone is not possible, this project is much faster way of identifying the location of an accident and can create a more effective ways of saving lives.
